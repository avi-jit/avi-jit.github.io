## Filmmaking
I've made a couple of short films and videos in college:
1. [Stoppping by Woods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uy_3XKqsJZk&index=1&list=LLtEZVFh2Arwg_BjXfz418kA) - a long short film on conversations.
2. [World War 2 jet in our campus](https://www.facebook.com/fmc.iitbhu/videos/747155185437805/) - a documentary on a very rare artefact inside IIT (BHU) and the fascinating story behind it.
3. [10 ways LC and Facebook is the same thing](https://www.facebook.com/fmc.iitbhu/videos/807030382783618/) - a comedy sketch on how our college hotspot resembles Facebook-ing

## Writing
I write articles, stories, newspapers, blogs, songs and novels. Some of them are:

2. **Short stories book**: Martyrs' Horizon
3. **Newspaper**: Articles for college newsletter, school newspaper
4. **Rap songs**: Variants of Eminem's released versions like Rap God and Fast Lane.
5. **Blog**: I've now switched to blogging on [Medium](https://medium.com/@avijitthawani)

## Data viz
I love playing around with data. Some of my data science and visualization projects have been:
1. Intranet portal of student pics
2. Samsung employee entry/exit data
3. Internet usage statistics in campus
4. Singapore weather data modeling

## Sketching
I and my brother [Siddharth Thawani](https://in.linkedin.com/in/siddharth-thawani) loved cartooning as kids (he still does) and sketched several comics on complicated storylines like pirate attacks, superhero teams, gangster adventures, and ship hijacks.

## Crafts
I've helped my friend Akash in co-founding a startup called [HandyPresents](https://www.facebook.com/handypresents/) which makes persoanlised handmade gifts for special occasions. I liked to think of giftmaking as an industry that needs to level up from an art to an engineering scale.

## Misc
As a freshman in college, I tried my hands on all sorts of extra curricular activities:
1. **Street Play**: on blood donation at a slum colony near our campus.
2. **Dance**: ranging from Bhangra to Pop to Govinda dance, we did it all!
3. **Robotics**: stood 1st at a robot making and handling event - my best day in life so far with several ups and downs and an amazing climax! 
4. **Skit**: on media corruption. I played Rahul Gandhi!
5. **Contraption**: at a contest called Goldberg's Alley. For those who don't know what a contraption is, think of the set of traps that Tom often set up for Jerry to step into. One action leads to another and finally resulting in a reaction.
