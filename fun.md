## Filmmaking
I've made a couple of short films and videos in college:
1. [Stoppping by Woods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uy_3XKqsJZk) - a long short film on conversations.
2. [World War 2 jet in our campus](https://www.facebook.com/fmc.iitbhu/videos/747155185437805/) - a documentary on a very rare artefact inside IIT (BHU) and the fascinating story behind it.
3. [10 ways LC and Facebook is the same thing](https://www.facebook.com/fmc.iitbhu/videos/807030382783618/) - a comedy sketch on how our college hotspot resembles Facebook-ing
4. The Last Date - a cute short flick, that is yet to be compiled and released!

## Writing
I write articles, stories, newspapers, blogs, songs and novels. Some of them are:

3. **Newspaper**: Articles for the college newsletter [Quest](https://issuu.com/thequest_iitbhu) at IIT BHU, and the school newsletter at City Montessori School
4. **Blog**: I've now switched to blogging on [Medium](https://medium.com/@avijitthawani) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thawani_avijit)

## Data viz
I love playing around with data. Some of my data science and visualization projects have been:
1. Intranet portal of student pics (FaceTrash)
2. Samsung employee entry/exit data (Knox)
3. Internet usage statistics in campus (Squish)
4. Singapore weather data modeling (SUTD Smart City)

## Sketching
I and my brother [Siddharth Thawani](https://in.linkedin.com/in/siddharth-thawani) loved cartooning as kids (he still does) and sketched several comics.

## Crafts
I've helped my friend Akash in co-founding a startup called [HandyPresents](https://www.facebook.com/handypresents/) which makes persoanlised handmade gifts for special occasions. Think of the 'Handwritten Greeting Cards' company as in the movie 'Her', but with more than just letters! We aggregate tinkering Instagram-ers and local craftsmen, with just the right amount of input from your end to deliver a one-of-a-kind experience for your loved ones.

## Misc
As a freshman in college, I tried my hands on all sorts of extra curricular activities:
1. **Street Play**: on blood donation at a slum near campus
2. **Dance**: ranging from Bhangra to David Guetta and Govinda dance, we did it all!
3. **Robotics**: stood 1st at a robot making and handling event - [the best day in my life](https://www.facebook.com/avijit.thawani/posts/796281477100748). If I scripted the day, I couldn't have made it any better (unless you allow me to script Emma Watson into the story) 
4. **Skit**: on media corruption. I played Rahul Gandhi!
5. **Contraption**: at a contest called Goldberg's Alley. For those who don't know what a contraption is, think of the set of traps that Tom often set up for Jerry to step into. One action leads to another and finally resulting in a reaction, which is usually Tom-caught-up-in-his-own-trap.
6. **Rap** songs in Hindi and English, inspired from [Kartavyo, the Sanskrit-English rap song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8oL_FKr1zw) by Arihant and Apoorv
7. **Stand-up Comedy**: at the Lit Club and The Tripling Bistro
