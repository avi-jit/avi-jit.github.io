I'm Avijit (or **Avi**), a PhD student at USC / University of Southern California (Department of Computer Science at the USC Viterbi School of Engineering). Previously, I completed my Bachelors and Masters of Technology in Computer Science at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT BHU) Varanasi. I'm interested in challenging projects and love to collaborate with people who can keep up with my enthusiasm for work!
