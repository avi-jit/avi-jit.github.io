<!---# Updates

**2023:** Interned at Microsoft Research Cambridge (UK) with the Health Futures team, on the topic of Radiology Visual Question Answering. I was fortunate to present our [open-source literature review tool](https://github.com/EshaanAgg/Research-Literature-Manager) in a [talk at ISI](https://youtu.be/FUIq9-lJ9ag?si=YjWr4ZFZjReJsEI2). And Saras, my edtech AI chatbot, stood 3rd at VGSA Trojan Tank and was a semi-finalist at USC's New Venture Seed Contest.

**2022:** Interned at Amazon Lab126 with the Alexa Conversations team, on the topic of compositional generalization.
And presented work with Dipesh Kumar, at the ACL 2022 Workshop on Negative Insights, Dublin.

**2021:** Interned at AI2, Seattle.
Tragic times in India. In between arranging oxygen for dying relatives and myself recovering from Covid-19, I tried to [visualize](https://avi-jit.github.io/covid-india/scatter) the scale of the Indian crisis for Americans to better comprehend it. 
Meanwhile, our NAACL 2021 Survey on [Numeracy in NLP](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2021.naacl-main.53/) featured in [Sebastian Ruder's NLP newsletter](https://newsletter.ruder.io/issues/eacl-iclr-naacl-papers-round-up-research-reality-checks-ml-on-code-592784)!

**2020:** Selected for [MLSS 2020](http://mlss.tuebingen.mpg.de/2020/schedule.html). We also fundraised registration fees to sponsor four Indian undergrads' attendance at [EMNLP 2020](https://2020.emnlp.org/). In other news, [TG](https://isi.edu/~tg/), [Harsh](https://harsh-agarwal.github.io/about/), and I submitted a proposal to the [government of India](http://thesciencepolicyforum.org/initiatives/eti/) on identifying Indian vernacular NLP as an emerging technology. Update: Our proposal was unfortunately not selected, but we'd love to hear your feedback so here's [the link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ObqEGVVx3Co7LrwipsFuJddm1CRnLjAe6D2we7XSzRI/edit?usp=sharing).
