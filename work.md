I believe every individual on earth has the right to _conveniently_ **express** and **access** the amazing ideas and thoughts that others (or they themselves) have, or have ever had. I just work on the convenience part. Things I've worked on or am working on are:

## Express ideas:
1. DesignAR
2. Stopping by Woods
3. Handwriting-to-Text
4. Moleskine

## Access ideas:
1. Opinion Summarization
2. K-Note Document Retrieval
