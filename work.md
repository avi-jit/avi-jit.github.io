I believe every individual on earth has the right to _conveniently_ **express** and **access** the amazing ideas and thoughts that others (or they themselves) have, or have ever had. I just work on the convenience part. Things I've worked on or am working on are:

## Express ideas:
### DesignAR
I and [Harsh](http://harsh-agarwal.github.io/) set about to develop an Augmented Reality smartphone application where people could visualize their designs and let it interact with the real world. Imagine a fashion desinger who could see how her new design looks on a mannequin without ever printing the fabrics in the first place! We set several milestones before us and cleared them one by one:
1. Samsung Virtual Reality Appathon - executed an AR Ping Pong Game and stood 4th in campus
2. Code.Fun.Do Hackathon - created a fun physics game using Kinect depth sensors and some VR magic.
3. [Microsoft Imagine Cup Big Idea Pitch](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/microsoftimagine/2015/11/03/announcing_the_2016_big_idea_pitch_winners/) - pitched our project and stood #6 worldwide (Innovation Category 2016)
4. Startup Weekend - At Technex 2016, we were selected for guidance sessions with an angel investor. We eventually decided to work instead on getting the tech right first rather than enter the vicious cycle of entreprenuership and investment hunting.
5. Imagine Cup National Finals - finally showcased the prototype at National Finals 2016, New Delhi.

Over this 10 month long project, I had the good fortune of working with some amazing cohorts like [Gaurav Gutpa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gv22ga/), [Shreemoyee Sarkar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shreemoyeesarkar-iit/), [Nitin Gera](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nitingera1996/), [Akash Agrawal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/akash-agrawal94/), [Parth Bhargava](https://www.linkedin.com/in/parth-bhargava-215753a7/)

Harsh went on to work on SLAM, a computer vision method we used to implement our Augmented Reality product. Eventually he did an internship at University of Adelaide with [Prof. Ian Reid](https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~ianr/), one of the pioneering researchers in this field, whose very works we were attempting to recreate and deploy. I, on the other hand, shifted gears towards IoT (Internet of Things) and eventually NLP and IR (Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval).

### Handwriting-to-Text
As a course project with [Dr. Hari Prabhat Gupta](https://sites.google.com/site/hprabhatgupta/home), I worked on an intuitive way to write digitally. Our Android application allowed one to hold the smartphone like a pen and write (in the air) characters with it which are then recognized and transcribed to English alphabets. Imagine taking the most conveniently available personal digital assistant you have (a smartphone) and write as intuitively with it as you write with a pen.

I used Machine Learning to map sensor readings (accelerometer and gyroscope) to English alphabets and subsequent training, while [Robin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robin-khurana-0a3a3ab7/) - my teammate - helped with the Android implementation of it.

### Stopping by Woods
I happened to watch a few movies by Richard Linklater - particularly [Before Sunrise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9v6X-Dytlko), which struck a chord with me. I took up filmmaking as a medium of storytelling - to ask my viewers to get out there and talk their heart out, share the beautiful ideas they have, and hear out others' - that is the essence of living. Since I had no prior experience, I had to teach myself filmmaking over the course of two whole years. Along the way, I scripted and directed a [documentary on a warplane in my campus](https://www.facebook.com/fmc.iitbhu/videos/747155185437805/), a [comedy sketch video](https://www.facebook.com/fmc.iitbhu/videos/807030382783618/), and a romance short film (unreleased). In the spring of 2018, we released the end goal: the 20-minute short film called [Stopping by Woods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uy_3XKqsJZk&index=1&list=LLtEZVFh2Arwg_BjXfz418kA).

In an otherwise scientific living, my detour towards the artistic world of films allowed me the good fortune of working with several phenomenally talented and passionate individuals like [Mrigank Gaur](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEvQbmfOHFksKjz71KxexYQ), [Varshan Raj](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq0qcvRJMsNigqg4XB5msBg), [Sakshi Patil](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sakshi-patil/), [Harsh Agarwal](https://harsh-agarwal.github.io/), Ankur Goel, and Mayank.

### Moleskine
The Moleskine Smart Writing Assistant is a digital pen product that flawlessly converts handwriting to text and images, without any sort of obstructive interference with your intuitive outflow of thoughts. Here is a [cool video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-bdmV43roQ) showing how it works. Trust me I've been looking for such a solution for a few years now and no other product even comes close. I bought it (for a not-so-modest $220) the moment I saw it in action!

I'm currently exploring ways to integrate such technology into a more AI-enabled note-taking system, and also to expand its capabilties of digitizing stuff. For instance, imagine sketching mind-maps on your notebook and being able to edit it later on a Slideshow!

## Access ideas:
### Opinion Summarization
Have you ever had to undergo the daunting task of making out what people think about a product based on customer reviews? What about movie reviews? Opinion summarization from user-generated content has such crucial implications in today's world. Think of the social media biases that people develop and how such propaganda can easily act as a _Trump_ card in political campaigns. As part of my undergraduate and master's thesis, I've helped form the biggest dataset of labeled opinions for Amazon product reviews, along with a bunch of baseline methods to solve the same, eg. [Document Vectors](https://github.com/shreyansh26/RevOpiD) and [Implicit Feature Mining](https://github.com/Avee-81/implicit-features-RevOpiD).

With Dr. Julian McAuley acting as co-chair, we hosted a shared task at [IJCNLP 2017](https://sites.google.com/itbhu.ac.in/revopid-2017) (Taiwan) and a workshop at [ACM Hypertext 2018](https://sites.google.com/view/revopid-2018) (Baltimore). 

### Disentangling aspects in Opinions
I interned with [Dr. Byron C. Wallace](http://www.byronwallace.com/) at Northeastern University in the summer of 2018, working on analyzing online physician reviews from [RateMDs.com](RateMDs.com). 

### K-Note Document Retrieval
